		This driver implements the <a href="http://core.telegram.org/bots/api">Telegram Bot API</a>.
		<p>
		It allows to send/receive messages to/from Sfera through the <a href="http://telegram.org/">Telegram Messenger</a> application.<br />
		You can therefore trigger custom logic upon the receiving of messages or you can send out notifications triggered by other events.<br />
		Messages sent from Sfera can include medias too, such as images, documents, audio, etc.
		<p>
		To use this driver you need to <a href="http://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather">create a new Telegram Bot</a>.<br />
		Once you created it, add a Telegram driver instance to your Sfera installation and and set the token of your bot in the <code>token</code> 
		configuration parameter. Also, specify a secret passphase in the <code>secret</code> configuration parameter that will be use to protect 
		the access to the Bot.
		<p>
		Once it is configured, launch Sfera and check the logs to make sure the driver is connected to the bot. Then, add your Telegram account to the trusted
		list of users by sending a message to the created bot saying '<code>/addme secret_passphase</code>'. For instance, if the passphrase you set in the
		configuration is "MySecret", send '<code>/addme MySecret</code>'.<br />
		If the operation is successful, you will get a replay saying "OK". From now on, every message sent from this account to the bot will trigger an event.
